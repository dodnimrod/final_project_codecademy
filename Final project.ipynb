    "In football, similar to every competitive sports, hosting is often considered as advantage, whether the host is a nation, a city, or even a different ground in the same neighborhood. There are several factors behind this conception, like the host athletes familiarity with the contest ground, or sometimes the long journey the guest athletes have to pass, but the most important factor is regarded as the local audience support, which can encourage the host, discourage the guest and can even effect the referees decision in favor of the host.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I can guess that in the majority of football leagues over the world, the host team (which can also be called the **home team**) enjoys the support of explicit larger quantity of audience compare to the guest team (which can also be called the __away team__). However, in case of the Israeli major football league, this statement isn't quite accurate, because a match in which the away audience exceeds the home audience in quantity isn't rare, and then the away team actually wins the most critical advantage of hosting.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Therefore, I assume that audience quantity superiority effects of the matches final results more than hosting only. In this project I would like to compare the host advantage against the audience quantity superiority according to the matches final results, in the Israeli major football league during the last seasons, and find out if there are significant differences between them."

It might indicate that the audience quantity superiority has more effect on the team probability to win then just hosting, but yet both p-values are far bigger than the significance threshold, so even if there is difference between them, it will be hardly expressed in reality, because **both factors doesn't concretely effect the matches results**."

    "In this project, I've differentiated the factors of match hosting and quantity superiority of one of the teams audience, and statistically tested the effect of each one of them on the matches final results, and then compared the differences between them, expecting that the second one is more effective factor than the first. For this purpose I've collected data from the Israeli major football league, which is a good example of a league where the hosting team isn't necessarily the one with audience quantity superiority.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Afterward I've defined criteria for what is significant audience quantity superiority (according to quantities ratio thresholds) and have tidied the data so I've left with data includes matches that ended with one of the teams win (i.e no draws) and had an audience quantity superiority to the home team or the away team.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the **first comparison** I've assumed that all data matches are independent (both teams have the same probability to win) with a lack of the hosting or audience quantity superiority factors, predefined a significance threshold, and then I've statistically tested if each of the factors presence had biased the probability to win in favor of the host and the team with audience quantity superiority respectively. Both tests showed probability bias as expected- the first test showed that home team has better chance to win the match than the away team, and the second test showed that team with audience quantity superiority has better chance to win the match than the other team, but the second test result was much more significant than the first test result, so, according to the first comparison, audience quantity superiority seems more effective on the match result than hosting, as expected.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "But in reality, the independency assumption of the first comparison isn't true. By this assumption, I've ignored a very important factor- the quality difference between teams. In many matches there is one team that is more quality than the other and therefore has better chance to win. Moreover, there may be a positive correlation between team quality and its audience quantity, and this optional correlation may have effected the first comparison results. Therefore, in the **second comparison** I've defined criterion for what is significant quality difference between teams according to their ranking in the league season final table. After tidying, I've left with data includes matches without significant quality difference, and for this data I've assumed that all matches are independent with a lack of the hosting or audience quantity superiority factors, and then repeated both tests of the first comparison. In these tests, even though the audience quantity superiority test showed better result then the hosting test result, both results were far from showing any effection of the tested factors on the matches results. Therefore, I can't say that my expectation was fulfilled."
